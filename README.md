# Local Weather App

## Description
 I utilized CRUD (crete, read, update, and delete) operations on the firebase database using the Open Weather API. Jquery, grunt, browserify, and bootstrap were the technologies used to make this application. This application allows you to search for your current weather and five day forecast by searching by zipcode. Firebase's authentication was used to allow a user to register and sign into the application. Once signed in one can save weather, delete weather, and state of a forecast appears scary to them. One also has the ability to sign out to the application once they are finished.
